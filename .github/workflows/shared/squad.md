# Squad Bootstrap Component — installs and initializes Squad
# (https://github.com/bradygaster/squad) in the activation job, then hands off
# the generated team state to the agent job.
#
# This is the DISTRIBUTION version of the bootstrap, living under workflows/shared/
# so users can pull it via:
#   gh aw add bradygaster/squad/workflows/squad.md@latest
#
# Design credit: adapted from Peli de Halleux's proven gh-aw integration in
# github/gh-aw. Original:
#   https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/main/.github/workflows/shared/squad.md
#
# The Squad CLI is never installed or executed in the agent job — only the files it
# produces (`.squad/` team state and `.github/agents/squad.agent.md`) are restored
# there. This is deliberate: gh-aw's network firewall only constrains the agent job,
# so the npm install and initialization happen in the unrestricted activation job.
#
# Usage (as an import in your gh-aw workflow):
#   imports:
#     - shared/squad.md
#
# Usage (remote import, pinned to a ref):
#   imports:
#     - bradygaster/squad/workflows/shared/squad.md@latest
#   (Pin to a SHA for reproducible builds:
#     - bradygaster/squad/workflows/shared/squad.md@<40-char-commit-sha>)
#
# How the coordinator reaches the agent: gh-aw natively restores files under
# `.github/agents/*.agent.md` as inline sub-agents. The `squad.agent.md` that
# `squad init` writes is picked up by that mechanism. Additionally, `engine.agent`
# is set to `squad`, so the compiler emits `--agent squad` on the Copilot invocation.
#
# `ambient-folders` (gh-aw main): upstream now uses a top-level
# `ambient-folders: [.squad, .github/agents]` key to bundle Squad's files into the
# standard activation artifact. That feature is unreleased on stable — once it ships,
# the explicit artifact upload/download below can be replaced.
#
# Optional custom credentials for `squad init`:
#   vars.SQUAD_GITHUB_APP_ID / secrets.SQUAD_GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY / vars.SQUAD_GITHUB_APP_OWNER
#     — mints a GitHub App installation token
#   secrets.SQUAD_GITHUB_TOKEN
#     — fallback if the App ID is not set
# Auth precedence: GitHub App installation token > SQUAD_GITHUB_TOKEN > github.token
#
# Optional custom Squad CLI version:
#   vars.SQUAD_CLI_VERSION
#   Default is 0.11.0.
#
# State backend is pinned to `local`: the compiled agent invocation passes
# `--disable-builtin-mcps`, so Squad's `state-mcp` bridge does not load. A non-local
# backend would fail silently. Cross-run state does NOT persist — every run starts
# from a fresh `squad init`.

## Squad Bootstrap Component

This shared component handles the entire Squad install/init lifecycle outside the
agent sandbox:

1. **`jobs.activation.pre-steps`** — the repository is already checked out by the
   activation job. This step optionally mints a GitHub App installation token (or
   uses a supplied PAT), runs the pinned `@bradygaster/squad-cli` package, and
   uploads the resulting `.squad/` team state plus
   `.github/agents/squad.agent.md` as a `squad-state` artifact — all inside the
   activation job with unrestricted egress.

2. **`steps:`** (agent job) — downloads the `squad-state` artifact and restores it
   into the workspace. The Squad CLI is never installed here; only the files it
   produced are needed.

-->

## Working with Squad

Squad's team state (`.squad/`) and its Copilot custom agent
(`.github/agents/squad.agent.md`) were initialized during activation and restored
into this checkout before you started — do **not** install Squad or run `squad init`
yourself.

- Verify `.squad/team.md` exists before delegating work to the team. If it is
  missing, the activation-job bootstrap step failed — call `noop` and explain
  why instead of proceeding.
- Coordinate work through the Squad team already defined in `.squad/` rather
  than proposing a brand-new team from scratch.
- This run uses the `local` state backend, and the Squad `state-mcp` bridge is
  **not** available (the agent runs with `--disable-builtin-mcps`). Treat `.squad/`
  as plain files on disk.
- State does **not** carry over between runs. The casting registry, session logs,
  and any output produced live only for this run.
